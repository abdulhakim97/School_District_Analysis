# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of the school district analysis:
  The purpose of this activity was to alter and update the overall school analysis, using the loc method to replace the 9th graders math and reading score from thomas highschool with a nan or n/a data update. After adding these changes we do a complete revamp of the entire school district analysis from when we did it earlier, since the THS 9th graders test scores have been nullyfied the entire analysis could be in troublw if we don't implement the new changes with our code.
